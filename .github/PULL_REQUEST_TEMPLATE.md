<!--
  Proposing a new rule or a rule change? Please open an issue here first:
  https://github.com/ufersa/eslint-config-sabia/issues
  
  If the rule has been accepted and you want to send a PR, please send it
  to: https://github.com/ufersa/eslint-config-sabia. Add the rule to the
  'eslintrc.json' file, in the "rules" field. This is where rules live
  until a new major version of sabia is released, at which point all
  new rules and rule changes are moved into eslint-config-sabia.
